Building Self

    A year ago I moved from Richmond, Virginia in the United States to Montreal for school. I knew no one in the city or in Canada either. 
    Seeing my own personality picked up and placed in an entirely new enviornment forced me to notice things about myself I never had before. 
    Among these realizations were all the little things I said, did, or thought that came from my friends and family back home. It makes me proud to be like them and to be able to bring certain ways of being into new spaces. Knowing I am made up of all the people in my life that I have ever loved makes me love myself more. Part of this piece is also about the way that you affect others around you. When you meet a Stranger their color is changed too. You are not able to see that layers inside of them but you can notice a slight shift in their colors. You get to see and appreciate their change from the outside.
